                  | Since 1965 Campus Events Commission (CEC) has been one of the largest purveyors of campus entertainment. Since its inception, it has acquired a reputation for its edgy style and controversial events. As one of the thirteen branches of UCLA's Undergraduate Student Association, CEC is a student-run, student-funded organization, dedicated to bringing the freshest fare in film, music and speakers to the UCLA community. CEC is comprised of seven branches--three programming and four marketing--individually responsible for their own duties, but all ultimately work together as one cohesive unit to provide well-marketed, high quality entertainment.
                .right 
                  | From hosting weekly free-$ movies to showing films before they hit theatres, CEC has become the students' premiere source for new cinema. CEC also brings the best in music programming to students by providing free quarterly concerts in various venues throughout the UCLA campus. In addition to providing new films and music, CEC coordinates speaking events from an eclectic variety of dignitaries.  CEC is also responsible for hosting the prestigious Jack Benny and Spencer Tracy Award ceremonies as well as the renowned Shorttakes Student Film Festival. Be it media seen or heard, Campus Events Commission is constantly in search of what is as evocative and diverse as its audience.

                  | The Films staff organizes free movies and free sneaks that bring UCLA students weekly movies, often before they even come out in theaters.  CEC has become students' go-to source for new cinema, creating the perfect platform for word-of-mouth marketing. We screen movies in UCLA's Ackerman Grand Ballroom, a theatre-like auditorium with 1,000 seat capacity (though sneaks usually seat 200-600 depending on studio preference). Ackerman features 20' x 40' screen dimension, Dolby Stereo Sound, digital projector with Blu-Ray player, and 35mm screen capability with platter system, handled by our trained and experienced projectionists. We also offer the option to screen on DVD or off laptop with DVD/LCD projectors.
                .right 
                  | In addition to screening these movies, we have also held occasional Q&As with filmmakers and actors like Maggie Carey, Seth Rogen, Stephen Chbosky, Creed Batton, and others.
